# CRISPRcleanR^2

v0.1.0: Correct combinatorial screens:
- collpase to 1 dimension (position 1 and 2)
- match with single screenings of the same cell line and create a model to map
- fill missing info in the collapsed version via genome-wide single screenings
- use CRISPRcleanR to correct
- decouple correction solving linear system and get pairwise correction
